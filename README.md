# FOpts

Fluent Options parser for Java

Joachim “Moonstroke” MARIE - 2024

## Description

This project offers a simple and efficient command-line processor for Java. It
defines a fluent (method calls can be chained) and event-driven interface (the
methods accept callbacks, invoked when the parser is run) for maximum reduction
of boilerplate code.
